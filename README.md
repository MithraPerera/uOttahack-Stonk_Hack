# SentimentStocks
SentimentStocks is a Flutter application (currently released [on the web](https://sentiment-stocks.web.app/)) that performs sentiment analysis on news articles and combines this data with COVID-19 case information to create a custom recommendation for which stocks may be on the rise in the near future.



## Why?

COVID-19 has brought many more recreational investors to the stock market. This means that social media is more influential than ever in terms of how people interact and how stock markets will behave. We wanted to find a way that we can capitalize on this shift in the market.



## How Does It Work?
